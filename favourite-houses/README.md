# Favourite Houses at funda

## Design challenge

Currently funda has a feature that is under utilized with great potential for better UX. The [saved houses section](https://www.funda.nl/en/mijn/bewaard/)(needs login) could be improved into a more collaborative and data enriched experience. Currently it's possible to save a house as favorite and rated it based on a few points but it can be improved.

We want to add scores to custom points that the user will define and be able to filter and order based on these custom ratings. Also, when you have a lot of houses, you may want to categorize them into different lists. Make sure that the user can create a list and add houses to them.

### Epic
Redesign the favorite houses page of a user.

## User stories

### 1) As a User, I want to be able to see all my saved houses so that I can have a general impression of which houses I'm interested in.
  * shows a picture of the house
  * shows a price tag
  * shows details (plot area, house size, rooms, energy label)
  * shows the broker

### 2) As a User, I want to be able to add a rating to a house so that I can keep track of what I like.

### 3) As a User, I want be able to create custom lists of houses so that I can easily catagorize houses.

## Data

There is a database in Directus you can use.

## Requirements

 * You implement the design according to the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/QJ6dtYVGW3l2DtFRx7eGdp/Object-(Externally-Shared)?node-id=0%3A1&t=1j0KhuCJpU7vqNuy-1). While not required, you have some room for creativity here if you want to improve on this design.
 * The page must be responsive. There should be a minimum of 3 breakpoints; mobile, tablet and desktop. (See design)
 * To ensure accessibility, use the appropriate semantic HTML tags and accessible attributes for your elements.
 * The elements on this page do not need to be interactive. The goal of this assignment is to build a layout.
 * Do not use any frameworks. Pure HTML and CSS only! While you probably won't need it, you can use javascript if necessary.
