Funda helps individuals during one of the most significant decisions in life: finding or selling a home. It's an exciting and challenging process, so Funda is committed to providing as much support as possible throughout this journey.

## Design challenge

Currently funda has a feature that is under utilized with great potential for better UX. The [saved houses section](https://www.funda.nl/en/mijn/bewaard/)(needs login) could be improved into a more collaborative and data enriched experience. Currently it's possible to save a house as favorite and rated it based on a few points but it can be improved.

We want to add scores to custom points that the user will define and be able to filter and order based on these custom ratings. Also, looking for a house is most of the times a collaboration between two or more people, so we want to give the opportunity to users to collaborate on this quest.

### Epic
Redesign the favorite houses page of a user.

### User stories

1) As a User, I want to be able to see all my saved houses so that I can have a general impression of which houses I'm interested in.
  
2) As a User, I want to be able to see all te details of a saved house so that I can reconsider if it is still a house I want to keep in my favorite houses list.
   
4) As a User, I want to be able to create custom ratting points so that so I have a better control over qualities of the object that I value.

5) As a User, I want be able to create custom lists of houses that can then be shared with another user so that we can together and on asynchronous way veto or approve houses that we like.

## Data

There is no data for a mocked endpoint. We can agree on a schema that is similar to the existing content on that page but since we expect data to be enhanced with extra fields, it will be up to the students to define the proper schema.
