## Design challenge

Currently funda has a feature that is under utilized with great potential for better UX. The [saved houses section](https://www.funda.nl/en/mijn/bewaard/)(needs login) could be improved into a more collaborative and data enriched experience. Currently it's possible to save a house as favorite and rated it based on a few points but it can be improved.

We want to add scores to custom points that the user will define and be able to filter and order based on these custom ratings. Also, looking for a house is most of the times a collaboration between two or more people, so we want to give the opportunity to users to collaborate on this quest.

### Epic
Redesign the favorite houses page of a user.

## User stories

### 1) As a User, I want to be able to see all my saved houses so that I can have a general impression of which houses I'm interested in.
  * shows a picture of the house
  * shows a price tag
  * shows details (plot area, house size, rooms, energy label)
  * shows the broker

### 2) As a User, I want to be able to add a rating to a house so that I can keep track of what I like.

### 3) As a User, I want be able to create custom lists of houses so that I can easily catagorize houses.
