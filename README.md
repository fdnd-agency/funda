## Assignment

In the first semester, you have learned a lot about layout, responsive design, accessibility, interaction and branding. In this 3 week sprint you will apply everything you have learned to rebuild the Listing Detail Page (LDP).

 * Go to https://www.funda.nl/koop/heel-nederland/
 * Click on any listing.

This is the Listing Detail Page. Your assignment is to rebuild this from scratch with HTML and CSS. You can use a bit of javascript, but it's not a necessity.

There is no need to get the data from any external source, you can just hard-code the data in your HTML.

## Requirements

 * You implement the design according to the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/QJ6dtYVGW3l2DtFRx7eGdp/Object-(Externally-Shared)?node-id=0%3A1&t=1j0KhuCJpU7vqNuy-1). While not required, you have some room for creativity here if you want to improve on this design.
 * The page must be responsive. There should be a minimum of 3 breakpoints; mobile, tablet and desktop. (See design)
 * To ensure accessibility, use the appropriate semantic HTML tags and accessible attributes for your elements.
 * The elements on this page do not need to be interactive. The goal of this assignment is to build a layout.
 * Do not use any frameworks. Pure HTML and CSS only! While you probably won't need it, you can use javascript if necessary.
