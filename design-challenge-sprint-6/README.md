In the first semester, you have learned a lot about layout, responsive design, accessibility, interaction and branding. In this 3 week sprint you will apply everything you have learned to rebuild the Media Viewer in the Listing Detail Page (LDP).

 * Go to https://www.funda.nl/koop/heel-nederland/
 * Click on any listing.

This is the Listing Detail Page. Your assignment is to rebuild the mediaviewer from scratch with HTML and CSS. You can use a bit of JavaScript, but it's not a necessity.

There is no need to get the data from any external source, you can just hard-code the data in your HTML.

## Requirements

 * You implement the design according to the Figma file.
 * The page must be responsive using a mobile-first approach. There should be a minimum of 3 breakpoints; mobile, tablet and desktop.
 * To ensure accessibility, use the appropriate semantic HTML tags and accessible attributes for your elements.
 * The elements on this page do not need to be interactive. The goal of this assignment is to build a layout.
 * Do not use any frameworks. Pure HTML and CSS only! While you probably won't need it, you can use javascript if necessary.
